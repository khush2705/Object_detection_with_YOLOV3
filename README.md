## TODO

- [x] [**YoloV4 object detector with opencv-python implementation**](https://youtu.be/1aL6tewfxFY)

- [x] I will create distance estimation using yolo object detection, its coming up soon In sha Allah ðŸ˜Š
Project Repository [Yolov4 Detection and Distance Estimation](https://github.com/Asadullah-Dal17/Yolov4-Detector-and-Distance-Estimator) 

## Installation

You Need [**Opencv Contrib**](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/)

--> **windows**
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.5.3.56
```
--> **Linux or Mac**

```
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python==4.5.3.56

```

Guess what you are done that was not hard, isn't it.ðŸ˜‰
